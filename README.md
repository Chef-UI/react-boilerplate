# React Boilerplate v2

*"Why not build your own boilerplate to speed up your react projects creation?"*

I've came to this idea to help those who likes work using react as main tool and as an alternative way for create-react-app.

Some of the most useful libs have been already added to this boilerplate, so you don't need to worry about setups.

### Instructions:

Use ```yarn``` or ```npm```as you like.
- ```install``` to install the packages
- ```docker:start``` to run the application inside a container
- ```docker:stop``` to stop running your application container
- ```run:dev``` to run your application locally (by webpack-dev-server)
